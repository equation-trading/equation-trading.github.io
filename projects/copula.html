		<p class="description">Kernel Smoothing is a nonparametric technique to expose structural trend in the sample data. Copula is a mathematical tool to describe dependence structure among multivariate random variables through their marginal distribution function. These tools are widely used in risk calculation.</p>
		<p class="smoothing">This toolset provides a smoothing service with normal, box, triangle and quadratic kernel functions. Either cumulative density (cdf) or inverse cumulative density (icdf) can be evaluated on a set of evaluation points with the given sample data.</p>
		<p class="copula">The copula service provides a copula fitting and copula simulation for elliptical copulas (Gaussian/student-t) and Archimedean family (AMH/Clayton/Frank/Gumbel/Joe). Either Student-t or Archimedean copulas can be used to model tail dependency for with given marginal distributions.</p>
